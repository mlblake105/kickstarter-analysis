# kickstarter-analysis
Performing analysis on kickstarter data to uncover trends
### Overview
Fundraising campaigns have several factors which can influence their success or failure.  In this analysis we will focus specifically on launch dates and fundraising goals.  By the end we will be able to determine what month do the most successful campaigns occur, and what is a realistic fundraising goal.
#### Analysis
In this analysis data was put into line graphs to display the final outcomes.   The use of this type of graph allows us to see success vs failed over time for launch date outcomes.  It also allows us to see success vs failed percentage for goal amounts.

##### Challenges
During this analysis there were no difficulties coming to the conclusions.  Given the data set provided, difficulties could arise if you were not able to extract the subcategory to give us information specifically related to theater.  Another challenge that could arise would be if you were unable to determine the correct values to input into the countifs formula.  Incorrectly inputting the values could skew the entire data set for the goal groupings.
###### Results
*A fundraising campaign can take place at any time during the year.  Based on the data, however, for theater it is clear that successful campaigns are held during the month of May.  May had 111 successful campaigns, higher than any other month.  June came in close second with 100 successful campaigns. Based on this, spring and early summer should be the time you look to hold your fundraiser.  The least successful month for theater campaigns is December.  It appears that success rate starts to decline starting in October through the end of the year. It would not be recommended to begin a campaign in the fall or winter.
*Failed and cancelled campaign numbers both seem to remain stable throughout the year.  Failed campaigns do slightly spike in October, however, there have been no canceled campaigns during this month for theater fundraisers.  Although there is a spike in canceled fundraisers in October compared to September and November, May actually has the highest number of canceled with 52.
*In terms of determining your fundraising goal, based on historical theater fundraisers your fundraiser is equally likely to be successful or failed between $15,000 to $19,999.  The highest rate of success is for campaigns less than $1000 and failed is for campaigns between $45,000 to $49,999.  Based on this, it would be most beneficial to keep the amount you are looking to collect small.
####### Limitations
There are limitations to the data set.  The findings are based on a sample of countries, and not the entire world.  Including more countries and increasing the size of the data set could give a different result.  Also, in order to see additional information, you could look at average donation size success vs fail or length of campaign success vs fail.
